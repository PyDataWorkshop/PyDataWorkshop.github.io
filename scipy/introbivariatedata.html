\subsection{What is Bivariate and Multivariate data?}

A dataset with two variables contains what is called \textbf{bivariate data}. For example, the heights and weights of people (e.g. for the purposes of determining the extent to which taller people weigh more). Common bivariate statistical analyses include
\begin{itemize}
\item Correlation Analysis
\item Simple Linear Regression
\end{itemize}
Multivariate Data describes the situation where a phenomenum is described by two or more variables. For example, Height Weight Body Mass Index, Choloestorol level etc 


\subsection{Scatter Plot} A scatter plot of two variables shows the values of one variable on the Y axis and the values of the other variable on the X axis. Scatter plots are well suited for revealing the relationship between two variables. Scatterplots can be implemented using the \texttt{matplotlib} library using the command \texttt{\textbf{plot()}}

\subsubsection*{Exercise:} Let us construct scatter-plots for the \textbf{\textit{Immer}} and \textbf{\textit{Iris}} data sets.

\begin{framed}
\begin{verbatim}
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt


N = 50
x = np.random.rand(N)
y = np.random.rand(N)
colors = np.random.rand(N)
#area = np.pi * (15 * np.random.rand(N))**2 # 0 to 15 point radiuses

plt.scatter(x, y, s=area, c=colors, alpha=0.5)
plt.show()
\end{verbatim}
\end{framed}
More complex scatterplots, with better visual aesthetics, can be constructed. We will look at this more later on in the semester.
