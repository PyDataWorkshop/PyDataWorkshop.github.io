\section{Simple Linear Regression}
Simple linear regression is used to describe the mathematical relationship between two variables ‘x’ and ‘y’ in terms of a simple mathematical formula, of the form  (sometimes as $y = mx+c$, but usually)\[ y= a+bx.\]

For example, you may want to describe the relationship between age and blood pressure or the relationship between scores in a midterm exam and scores in the final exam, etc.

\begin{itemize}
\item	$x$ is the \textbf{independent} (i.e. predictor) variable.
\item	$y$ is the \textbf{dependent} (i.e. response) variable.
\end{itemize}
That is to say $x$ is said to cause or influence $y$.

\begin{itemize}
\item Necessarily both x and y should be of equal length. One of the first steps in a regression analysis is to determine if any kind of relationship exists between $x$ and $y$.

\item A scatterplot can created and can initially be used to get an idea about the nature of the relationship between the variables, e.g. if the relationship is linear, curvilinear, or no relationship exists.

\item To make a simple scatter-plot, we simply use the \texttt{\textbf{plot()}} command. The independent variable (the variable to go along the x-axis) is always specified first.
\end{itemize}
