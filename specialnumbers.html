<h5>Special Numbers : inf and NaN</h5>
<ul>

<li> \texttt{inf} represents infinity and \texttt{inf} is distinct from \texttt{-inf}.
<li> \texttt{inf} can be constructed in a number for ways, for
example or exp(710). 

<li> \texttt{nan} stands for <b>Not a Number</b>, and nans are created whenever a function produces
a result that cannot be clearly evaluated to produce a number or infinity. For example, \texttt{inf/-inf} results in
\texttt{nan}. 
<li> \texttt{nans} often cause problems since most mathematical operations involving a \texttt{nan }produce a \texttt{nan}.
