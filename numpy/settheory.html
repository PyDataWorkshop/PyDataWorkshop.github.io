\section*{Set Theory : Set Operations with NumPy}

\begin{itemize}
\item Intersection (AND)
\item Union (OR)
\item Set Difference
\item Exclusive Or
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Making proper sets}
\begin{description}
\item[\texttt{unique()}]	Find the unique elements of an array.
\end{description}
\subsection{Boolean operations}

\begin{description}
\item[\texttt{in1d()}]	Test whether each element of a 1-D array is also present in a second array.
\item[\texttt{intersect1d()}]	Find the intersection of two arrays.
\item[\texttt{setdiff1d()}]	Find the set difference of two arrays.
\item[\texttt{setxor1d()}]	Find the set exclusive-or of two arrays.
\item[\texttt{union1d()}]	Find the union of two arrays.
\end{description}
