#### NumPy - Data Types

NumPy supports a much greater variety of numerical types than Python does. The following table shows different scalar data types defined in NumPy.

```


```python
1. ``bool_``: Boolean (True or False) stored as a byte
2. ``int_``: Default integer type (same as C long; normally either int64 or int32)
3. ``intc``: Identical to C int (normally int32 or int64)
4. ``intp``: Integer used for indexing (same as C ssize_t; normally either int32 or int64)
5. ``int8``: Byte (-128 to 127)
6. ``int16``: Integer (-32768 to 32767)
7. int32
Integer (-2147483648 to 2147483647)
8. ``int64``: Integer (-9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807)
9. ``uint8``: Unsigned integer (0 to 255)
10. ``uint16``: Unsigned integer (0 to 65535)
11. ``uint32``: Unsigned integer (0 to 4294967295)
12. ``uint64``: Unsigned integer (0 to 18446744073709551615)
13. float_
Shorthand for float64
14. float16
Half precision float: sign bit, 5 bits exponent, 10 bits mantissa
15. float32
Single precision float: sign bit, 8 bits exponent, 23 bits mantissa
16. float64
Double precision float: sign bit, 11 bits exponent, 52 bits mantissa
17. complex_
Shorthand for complex128
18. complex64
Complex number, represented by two 32-bit floats (real and imaginary components)
19. complex128
Complex number, represented by two 64-bit floats (real and imaginary components)
NumPy numerical types are instances of dtype (data-type) objects, each having unique characteristics. The dtypes are available as np.bool_, np.float32, etc.

```


```python
Data Type Objects (dtype)
A data type object describes interpretation of fixed block of memory corresponding to an array, depending on the following aspects −
Type of data (integer, float or Python object)
```


```python
Size of data
Byte order (little-endian or big-endian)
In case of structured type, the names of fields, data type of each field and part of the memory block taken by each field.
If data type is a subarray, its shape and data type
The byte order is decided by prefixing '<' or '>' to data type. '<' means that encoding is little-endian (least significant is stored in smallest address). '>' means that encoding is big-endian (most significant byte is stored in smallest address).
A dtype object is constructed using the following syntax −
<pre><code>
numpy.dtype(object, align, copy)
</code></pre>
```

The parameters are −

* ``Object`` − To be converted to data type object
* ``Align`` − If true, adds padding to the field to make it similar to C-struct
* ``Copy`` − Makes a new copy of dtype object. If false, the result is reference to builtin data type object


```python
Example 1
 Live Demo
# using array-scalar type 
import numpy as np 
dt = np.dtype(np.int32) 
print dt
The output is as follows −
int32
```


```python
Example 2
 Live Demo
#int8, int16, int32, int64 can be replaced by equivalent string 'i1', 'i2','i4', etc. 
import numpy as np 

dt = np.dtype('i4')
print dt 
The output is as follows −
int32
```


```python



Example 3
 Live Demo
# using endian notation 
import numpy as np 
dt = np.dtype('>i4') 
print dt
The output is as follows −
>i4

```

The following examples show the use of structured data type. 
Here, the field name and the corresponding scalar data type is to be declared.


#### Example 4


```python
# first create structured data type 
import numpy as np 
dt = np.dtype([('age',np.int8)]) 
print(dt) 

```

    [('age', 'i1')]



```python

Example 5
 Live Demo
# now apply it to ndarray object 
import numpy as np 

dt = np.dtype([('age',np.int8)]) 
a = np.array([(10,),(20,),(30,)], dtype = dt) 
print a
The output is as follows −
[(10,) (20,) (30,)]
```


```python
Example 6
 Live Demo
# file name can be used to access content of age column 
import numpy as np 

dt = np.dtype([('age',np.int8)]) 
a = np.array([(10,),(20,),(30,)], dtype = dt) 
print a['age']
The output is as follows −
[10 20 30]
```


```python

Example 7
The following examples define a structured data type called student with a string field 'name', an integer field 'age' and a float field 'marks'. This dtype is applied to ndarray object.
 Live Demo
```


```python

import numpy as np 
student = np.dtype([('name','S20'), ('age', 'i1'), ('marks', 'f4')]) 
print(student)
```


```python


Example 8
 Live Demo
import numpy as np 

student = np.dtype([('name','S20'), ('age', 'i1'), ('marks', 'f4')]) 
a = np.array([('abc', 21, 50),('xyz', 18, 75)], dtype = student) 
print a


```


```python
The output is as follows −
[('abc', 21, 50.0), ('xyz', 18, 75.0)]
Each built-in data type has a character code that uniquely identifies it.
'b' − boolean
'i' − (signed) integer
'u' − unsigned integer
'f' − floating-point
'c' − complex-floating point
'm' − timedelta
'M' − datetime
'O' − (Python) objects
'S', 'a' − (byte-)string
'U' − Unicode
'V' − raw data (void)

```
