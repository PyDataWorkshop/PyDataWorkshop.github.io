Open - the opening stock price on a particular day
Close - the closing stock price on a particular day
high - the highest stock price on a particular day
Low - price on a particular day

Suppose we want to determine the following values for each day

DiffOC - Difference between Opening and Closing Price
DiffHL - Difference between High and Low Price.

and add these values to our data frame.


DiffOC = sbux['Open'] - sbux['Close']
DiffHL = sbux['High'] - sbux['Low']
