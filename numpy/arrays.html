<h1>Arrays and Matrices</h1>
\textit{\textbf{NumPy}} provides the most important data types for econometrics, statistics and numerical analysis – \textbf{arrays}
and \textbf{matrices}. The difference between these two data types are:
<ul>
<li> Arrays can have 1, 2, 3 or more dimensions, and matrices \textbf{always} have 2 dimensions. This means
that a 1 by n vector stored as an array has 1 dimension and n elements, while the same vector stored
as a matrix has 2-dimensions where the sizes of the dimensions are 1 and n (in either order).
<li>  Standard mathematical operators on arrays operate element-by-element. This is not the case for
matrices, where multiplication ($\ast$) follows the rules of \textit{linear algebra}.
<li> 2-dimensional arrays can be
multiplied using the rules of linear algebra using dot. 
<li> Similarly, the function multiply can be used
on two matrices for \textit{element-by-element} multiplication.
<li>  Arrays are more common than matrices, and all functions are thoroughly tested with arrays. 
<li> Functions
should also work with matrices, but an occasional strange result may be encountered.
<li>  Arrays can be quickly treated as a matrix using either \texttt{asmatrix} or \texttt{mat} without copying the underlying
data.
</ul>
The best practice is to use arrays and to use the \texttt{asmatrix} view when writing linear algebra-heavy code. It is
also important to test any custom function with both arrays and matrices to ensure that false assumptions
about the behavior of multiplication have not been made.

<h2>Arrays</h2>
Arrays are the base data type in NumPy, are are arrays in some ways similar to lists since they both contain
collections of elements. The focus of this section is on \textit{homogeneous} arrays containing numeric data
– that is, an array where all elements have the same numeric type


Additionally, arrays, unlike lists, are always rectangular so that all rows have the same
number of elements.

Arrays are initialized from lists (or tuples) using array. Two-dimensional arrays are initialized using
lists of lists (or tuples of tuples, or lists of tuples, etc.), and higher dimensional arrays can be initialized by
further nesting lists or tuples.

<pre>
<code>
>>> x = [0.0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
>>> y = array(x)
>>> y
array([ 0., 1., 2., 3., 4.])
>>> type(y)
numpy.ndarray
</code>
</pre>
Two (or higher) -dimensional arrays are initialized using nested lists.
<pre>
<code>
>>> y = array([[0.0, 1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]])
>>> y
array([[ 0., 1., 2., 3., 4.],
[ 5., 6., 7., 8., 9.]])
>>> shape(y)
(2L, 5L)
>>> y = array([[[1,2],[3,4]],[[5,6],[7,8]]])
>>> y
array([[[1, 2],
[3, 4]],
[[5, 6],
[7, 8]]])
>>> shape(y)
(2L, 2L, 2L)
</code>
</pre>
<h2>Array dtypes</h2>

Homogeneous arrays can contain a variety of numeric data types. The most useful is ’\texttt{float64}’, which corresponds
to the python built-in data type of float (andC/C++double). By default, calls to array will preserve
the type of the input, if possible. If an input contains all integers, it will have a dtype of ’int32’ (similar to
the built in data type int). If an input contains integers, floats, or a mix of the two, the array’s data type will
be float64. If the input contains a mix of integers, floats and complex types, the array will be initialized
to hold complex data.
<pre>
<code>
>>> x = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] # Integers
>>> y = array(x)
>>> y.dtype
dtype(’int32’)
>>> x = [0.0, 1, 2, 3, 4] # 0.0 is a float
>>> y = array(x)
>>> y.dtype
dtype(’float64’)
>>> x = [0.0 + 1j, 1, 2, 3, 4] # (0.0 + 1j) is a complex
>>> y = array(x)
>>> y
array([ 0.+1.j, 1.+0.j, 2.+0.j, 3.+0.j, 4.+0.j])
>>> y.dtype
dtype(’complex128’)
</code>
</pre>
NumPy attempts to find the smallest data type which can represent the data when constructing an array.
It is possible to force NumPy to select a particular dtype by using the keyword argument dtype=datetype
when initializing the array.
<pre>
<code>
>>> x = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] # Integers
>>> y = array(x)
>>> y.dtype
dtype(’int32’)
>>> y = array(x, dtype=’float64’) # String dtype
>>> y.dtype
dtype(’float64’)
>>> y = array(x, dtype=float64) # NumPy type dtype
>>> y.dtype
dtype(’float64’)
</code>
</pre>
