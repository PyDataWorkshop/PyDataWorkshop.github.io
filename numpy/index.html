\section{NumPy}
NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It contains among other things:
\begin{itemize}
\item a powerful N-dimensional array object
\item sophisticated (broadcasting) functions
\item tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code
\item useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities
\end{itemize}
 Besides its obvious scientific uses, NumPy can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data. Arbitrary data-types can be defined. This allows NumPy to seamlessly and speedily integrate with a wide variety of databases.\\
