Support vector machines (SVMs) are a set of supervised learning methods used for classification, regression and outliers detection.

#### Advantages
The advantages of support vector machines are:

- Effective in high dimensional spaces.
- Still effective in cases where number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples.
- Uses a subset of training points in the decision function (called support vectors), so it is also memory efficient.

Versatile: different Kernel functions can be specified for the decision function. 
Common kernels are provided, but it is also possible to specify custom kernels.


#### Disadvantage
The disadvantages of support vector machines include:
- If the number of features is much greater than the number of samples, the method is likely to give poor performances.
- SVMs do not directly provide probability estimates, these are calculated using an expensive five-fold cross-validation.

### 1.2.4 Complexity

Support Vector Machines are powerful tools, but their compute and storage requirements increase rapidly with the number of training vectors. The core of an SVM is a quadratic programming problem (QP), separating support vectors from the rest of the training data.
