Pearson Residuals

The Pearson residual is the raw residual divided by the square root of the variance function {V(\mu)}.
The Pearson residual is the individual contribution to the Pearson \chi^2 statistic. For a binomial distribution with mi trials in the ith observation, it is defined as

r_{Pi} = \sqrt{ m_{i}}
 \frac{r_{i}}{\sqrt{V(\hat{ \mu_{i}})}}
For other distributions, the Pearson residual is defined as

r_{Pi} = \frac{r_{i}}{\sqrt{V(\hat{ \mu_{i}})}}
The Pearson residuals can be used to check the model fit at each observation for generalized linear models. These residuals are stored in variables named RP_yname for each response variable, where yname is the response variable name. 
The standardized and studentized Pearson residuals are

r_{Psi} = \frac{r_{Pi}}{\sqrt{\hat{ \phi} (1- h_{i})} }
r_{Pti} = \frac{r_{Pi}}{\sqrt{ \hat{ \phi}_{(i)}
 (1- h_{i})} }
