### Classification with scikit-learn

<h3>Classification with scikit-learn</h3>
<ul>
<li> This post looks into the problem of classification, a situation in which a response is a categorical variable. 
<li> We will build upon the techniques that we previously discussed in the context of regression and show how they can be transferred to classification problems. 
<li> This post introduces a number of classification techniques, and it will try to convey their corresponding strengths and weaknesses by visually inspecting the decision boundaries for each model.
<\ul>



<ul>
<li> This is part of a series of blog posts showing how to do common statistical learning techniques with Python. 
<li> We provide only a small amount of background on the concepts and techniques we cover, so if you’d like a more thorough explanation check out Introduction to Statistical Learning or sign up for the free online course run by the book’s authors here.

#### Scikit-learn
In this post we will use \textbf{scikit-learn}, an easy-to-use, general-purpose toolbox for machine learning in Python. We will use it extensively in the coming posts in this series so it’s worth spending some time to introduce it thoroughly.

<ul>
<li> Scikit-learn is a library that provides a variety of both supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques. 
<li> Supervised machine learning refers to the problem of inferring a function from labeled training data, and it comprises both regression and classification. 
<\ul>


Classification is the problem of identifying to which of a set of categories (sub-populations) a new observation belongs, on the basis of a training set of data containing observations (or instances) whose category membership is known.

An example would be assigning a given email into "spam" or "non-spam" classes or assigning a diagnosis to a given patient as described by observed characteristics of the patient (gender, blood pressure, presence or absence of certain symptoms, etc.).
In the terminology of machine learning, classification is considered an instance of <strong>supervised learning,</strong> i.e. learning where a training set of correctly identified observations is available. The corresponding unsupervised procedure is known as clustering, and involves grouping data into categories based on some measure of inherent similarity or distance.

<h4>Unspervised Learning</h4>
<ul>
<li>  Unsupervised machine learning, on the other hand, refers to the problem of finding interesting patterns or structure in the data; it comprises techniques such as clustering and dimensionality reduction.
<li>  In addition to statistical learning techniques, scikit-learn provides utilities for common tasks such as model selection, feature extraction, and feature selection.
