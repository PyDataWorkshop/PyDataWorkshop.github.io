1.12 Perceptron
======================
The Perceptron is another simple algorithm suitable for large scale learning. By default:
- It does not require a learning rate.
- It is not regularized (penalized).
- It updates its model only on mistakes.

The last characteristic implies that the Perceptron is slightly faster to train than SGD with the hinge loss and that the resulting models are sparser.
