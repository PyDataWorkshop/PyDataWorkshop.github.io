    \textit{pandas} is a high-performance module that provides a comprehensive set of structures for working with
   data. 
    \textit{pandas} excels at handling structured data, such as data sets containing many variables, working with
   missing values and merging across multiple data sets.

  While extremely useful, \textit{pandas} is not an essential
 component of the Python scientific stack unlike NumPy, SciPy or matplotlib, and so while pandas doesnâ€™t
 make data analysis possible in Python, it makes it much easier.  textit{pandas} also provides high-performance,
 robust methods for importing from and exporting to a wide range of formats.

 \textbf{Data Structures}\\

\textit{pandas} provides a set of data structures which include <tt>{Series}, <tt>{DataFrames} and <tt>{Panels}.
 
*  \textbf{Series} are 1-dimensional
 arrays.
  \textbf{DataFrames} are collections of Series and so are 2-dimensional, 
*   \textbf{Panels} are collections ofDataFrames,
 and so are 3-dimensional.
