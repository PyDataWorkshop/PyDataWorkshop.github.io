What is Scikit-Learn (Sklearn)
Scikit-learn (Sklearn) is the most useful and robust library for machine learning in Python. It provides a selection of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction via a consistence interface in Python. This library, which is largely written in Python, is built upon NumPy, SciPy and Matplotlib.

Origin of Scikit-Learn
It was originally called scikits.learn and was initially developed by David Cournapeau as a Google summer of code project in 2007. Later, in 2010, Fabian Pedregosa, Gael Varoquaux, Alexandre Gramfort, and Vincent Michel, from FIRCA (French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation), took this project at another level and made the first public release (v0.1 beta) on 1st Feb. 2010.
